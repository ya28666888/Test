function score = BestDice(inLabel,gtLabel)
% inLabel: label image to be evaluated. Labels are assumed to be consecutive numbers.
% gtLabel: ground truth label image. Labels are assumed to be consecutive numbers.
% score: Dice score
%
% We assume that the lowest label in inLabel is background, same for gtLabel
% and do not use it. This is necessary to avoid that the trivial solution, 
% i.e. finding only background, gives excellent results.
%
% For the original Dice score, labels corresponding to each other need to
% be known in advance. Here we simply take the best matching label from 
% gtLabel in each comparison. We do not make sure that a label from gtLabel
% is used only once. Better measures may exist. Please enlighten me if I do
% something stupid here...
